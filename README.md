# Final Project – May 2025

This project explores how behavioral and lifestyle factors—such as sleep quality, stress level, physical activity, and age—may influence weight change.

We used real-world data from 100 individuals to conduct hypothesis testing and correlation analysis. The goal was to identify meaningful relationships between behavioral patterns and physical outcomes.

##Dataset

- 100 participants
- Variables include:
  - Age, Gender, Current Weight
  - BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)
  - Calories consumed, caloric surplus/deficit
  - Sleep quality, Stress level, Activity level
  - Duration (weeks), Weight change

## Methods Used

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- One-way ANOVA for sleep quality vs weight change
- Spearman correlation for stress vs weight change
- Pearson and Point-Biserial correlations for other relationships
- Heatmap to visualize numeric variable correlations

##  Key Findings

- **Sleep quality** significantly affected weight change. Better sleep was associated with more weight loss.
- **Stress level** showed a negative correlation with weight change. Higher stress was linked to less weight loss.
- **Age, gender, and activity level** did not have a statistically significant relationship with weight change.

##  Conclusion

Behavioral and psychological factors such as sleep and stress appear to be stronger predictors of weight change than demographic traits. This highlights the importance of holistic health strategies that address both physical and mental wellness.
